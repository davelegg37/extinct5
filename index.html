              To quote Pogo we have met the enemy and he is us. We are the sixth extinction and that extinction includes us. Words like us, he, we, they, allow us to avoid individual action by transferring responsibility for our actions to a collective they. “I’m innocent your Honor, It's Society's fault not mine” , doesn't work in a court of law and it won't in mother nature's court. When a species habitat deteriorates  so does the species. And when the  polar bear, bee, and tree go extinct so does their habitat and so do we. Extinction in the aprocene is caused by habitat destruction not comets.

The purpose of these  games is to place you in the driver's seat instead of “they”. So who killed cock robin or the polar bear? You did.
How to play the gameThe game consists of six games.  The goal of each of the games is to help the species escape the red extinction box in which it is trapped. You  do this by choosing individual actions you can take that will help save its habitat. Each species's habitat is different so things you do to help a polar bear probably won’t save a bee, or a tree. Some things you do are much more effective than others.You begin each game by choosing the species you wish to save and the level difficulty ( the number resources ) you will have. Resource units represent financial, social, psychological,habits and more. Each time you act costs you resources some more than others. The game ends when you run out of resources, save a species, or fail to save a species. There are six species you can try and save, polar bears, bees, and trees. You choose which one to try and save at the beginning of the game.

The level of difficulty represents where in history you begin. The game would have been easier if you had started to take your actions earlier. The longer you wait the harder it is to change. Thus the easiest level equals beginning to act in 1900, middle 1946, hardest 2020.
Steps of playStep 1 Choose the species you wish to save (takes you to the species habitat).Step 2 Choose the level of difficulty. These represent the years when you begin take the action.Step 3 In the species habitat choose the actions you wish to use to save the habitat. (be careful if you exceed your resources  the game ends). You can choose as many actions as you wish until your resources or actions run out.Step 4 When you have chosen, by clicking their buttons, you implement them by clicking the red Action button and observe what happens.
